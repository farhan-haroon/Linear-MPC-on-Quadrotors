# Linear MPC on Quadrotors 

This repositiory contains the SimuLink **Model** and the necessary Matlab **.mat** file to implement **Linear MPC** on a PixHawk based Quadrotor platform. The model employs the **Model Predictive Control**, **ROS**, and **Control Systems** toolboxes so make sure they are included with your MATLAB distribution.

Here is a picture of the Model for reference:
